  // Service node decommissioning: as service nodes stay up they earn "credits" (measured in blocks)
  // towards a future outage.  A new service node starts out with INITIAL_CREDIT, and then builds up
  // CREDIT_PER_DAY for each day the service node remains active up to a maximum of
  // DECOMMISSION_MAX_CREDIT.
  //
  // If a service node stops sending uptime proofs, a quorum will consider whether the service node
  // has built up enough credits (at least MINIMUM): if so, instead of submitting a deregistration,
  // it instead submits a decommission.  This removes the service node from the list of active
  // service nodes both for rewards and for any active network duties.  If the service node comes
  // back online (i.e. starts sending the required performance proofs again) before the credits run
  // out then a quorum will reinstate the service node using a recommission transaction, which adds
  // the service node back to the bottom of the service node reward list, and resets its accumulated
  // credits to 0.  If it does not come back online within the required number of blocks (i.e. the
  // accumulated credit at the point of decommissioning) then a quorum will send a permanent
  // deregistration transaction to the network, starting a 30-day deregistration count down.
