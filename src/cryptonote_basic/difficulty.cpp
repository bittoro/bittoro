  // This algorithm is: next_difficulty = harmonic_mean(Difficulties) * T / LWMA(Solvetimes)
  // The harmonic_mean(Difficulties) = 1/average(Targets) so it is also:
  // next_target = avg(Targets) * LWMA(Solvetimes) / T.
  // This is "the best algorithm" because it has lowest root-mean-square error between 
  // needed & actual difficulty during hash attacks while having the lowest standard 
  // deviation during stable hashrate. That is, it's the fastest for a given stability and vice versa.
  // Do not use "if solvetime < 1 then solvetime = 1" which allows a catastrophic exploit.
  // Do not sort timestamps.  "Solvetimes" and "LWMA" variables must allow negatives.
  // Do not use MTP as most recent block.  Do not use (POW)Limits, filtering, or tempering.
  // Do not forget to set N (aka DIFFICULTY_WINDOW in Cryptonote) to recommendation below.
  // The nodes' future time limit (FTL) aka CRYPTONOTE_BLOCK_FUTURE_TIME_LIMIT needs to
  // be reduced from 60*60*2 to 500 seconds to prevent timestamp manipulation from miner's with 
  //  > 50% hash power.  If this is too small, it can be increased to 1000 at a cost in protection.
